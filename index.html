    <!-- <p>Well, well, well. <br> Here we are again my old nemesis; an assignment about my least favorite subject, myself.<br>
    A short biography you say?<br> How does one write such a thing? <br> I was born and now I'm here? <br> The night sky was hidden by thick cumulonimbus clouds waiting to drench Lee Memorial Hospital with torrents of fat rain drops. Inside the hospital, the cries of my mother, deep into her 14th hour of labor, could be heard. <br> Then silence. <br> Then a slap. <br> Then my mother's painfilled grunts and screams were replaced by the cries of my newborn self. <br> My mother was silent as the nurse cleaned my tiny frame, but not in anticipation of meeting her newborn son, but because her newborn son's head was so huge that she had fallen unconscious during the last bit of labor. <br> 
  </p>
  <p>Family was an important concept growing up with my mom. We visited one set of grandparents every week it felt like. <br> Now that I write this, I realize that I'm having problems recalling correctly what has occured in my past.<br> This might be a good assignment to keep close and work on constantly to remind the self of past travels and to remember little details here and there which were previously forgotten.</p><br>
  <br>
  <p>Let's try again.</p> <br>
  <p>I was born; in a time before computers were mainstream; to a single mother who was still in highschool; in Fort Myers, Florida. My earliest memory is of me sitting in a fire ant hill. Little ants swarmed my body, each one taking a little nibble of my skin. I didn't move but continued to sit while these little creatures continued to slowly devour me. My mother did her best to raise me. I never went hungry nor did I have to spend time alone. My family was nearby. If my grandparents couldn't watch me, then one of my aunts </p>   -->
  <p> Hello there.
     My name is Joseph Sellars and writing about myself is one of my least favorite things to do, just above eating kitty litter covered cat feces. 
     I was born 08/27/1988 in Fort Myers, Florida. Evangelical Christian School had the pleasure of graduating me from highschool. 
     By the time I graduated highschool, my academic prowess was most excellent as I was ranked 51st of 52 students.</p> 
  <p>Three months after graduation I went off to Great Lakes Naval Base for navy bootcamp. 
    After getting kicked out of Cryptologic Technician A school in Pensacola, Florida for drinking underage, I went to the west coast fleet with an undesignated job classification.
    Three years of my naval career were spent aboard the USS Bunker Hill where I cross-rated over to Aviation Mechanic. 
    Before changing jobs I had the opportunity to experience some pretty cool side-jobs like master helmsman and rhib-coxswain. 
    09/10/2010 marked the end to my four year involvement with the USN.</p> 
  <p>For the next 10 years of my life I experienced opportunities working as a(n)</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>estimator for Arc Tech Fence and Construction</li>  
      <li>first mate aboard a sunset cruise liner called Sanibel Princess</li>
      <li>line cook at Joe's Bar in Key West</li> 
      <li>chimney sweep at Chimaree Chimney Company</li>
      <li>student indoc representative at FRCC</li>
      <li>owner at Gulf Coast Preservation Services</li>
      <li>produce guy at Target</li>
      <li>team member at Five Guys</li>
      <li>cabinet installer at Cabinet Creations and Installations</li>
      <li>delivery driver at Beach Bums</li>
      <li>delivery driver at Uber Eats</li>
    </ul>
  <p>My educational history includes taking classes at</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Florida Gulf Coast University for an english degree</li>
      <li>Front Range Community College for creative writing</li>
      <li>Florida Keys Community College for master diving</li>
      <li>Florida South Western for general studies</li>
    </ul>
  <p>I hear that as a new software engineer I should learn to love failure.<br>
    This seems to be a part of my persona already as I successfully failed to complete each degree that I was pursuing. <br>
    Short term goals include successfully finishing this lab on time and successfully finishing Code Fellows in it's software engineering course entirety.   
    Long term, I would love to create symbiosis between an AGI and human consciousness into one cyborg being.</p>
